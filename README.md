#Approximate String Matching: Trie and Edit Distance Implementation

* use "javac" to compile all java files
* run "java Preprocess" and output the turn.txt file, which is preprocessed.(turgenev.txt and Preprocess.class in the same directory).You can also use the turn.txt, which has been in the directory.
* run "java EditDistance" and output the editDResult.txt file, which is the edit-distance matching result.
* run "java Trie" and output the trieResult_prefix.txt and trieResult.txt file, which are the prefix-trie and mismatch-trie matching results.
* surnames_long.txt and turn_long.txt in directory "\src\trie" are the whole query set and dictionary set.
  You can use it on trie.
