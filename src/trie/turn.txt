a
novel
chapter
i
well
piotr
not
in
sight
yet
was
the
question
asked
on
may
the
th

by
a
gentleman
of
a
little
over
forty
in
a
dusty
coat
and
checked
trousers
who
came
out
without
his
hat
on
to
the
low
steps
of
the
posting
station
at
s
he
was
addressing
his
servant
a
chubby
young
fellow
with
whitish
down
on
his
chin
and
little
lack lustre
eyes
the
servant
in
whom
everything the
turquoise
ring
in
his
ear
the
streaky
hair
plastered
with
grease
and
the
civility
of
his
movements indicated
a
man
of
the
new
improved
generation
glanced
with
an
air
of
indulgence
along
the
road
and
made
answer
no
sir
not
in
sight
not
in
sight
repeated
his
master
no
sir
responded
the
man
a
second
time
his
master
sighed
and
sat
down
on
a
little
bench
we
will
introduce
him
to
the
reader
while
he
sits
his
feet
tucked
under
him
gazing
thoughtfully
round
his
name
was
nikolai
petrovitch
kirsanov
he
had
twelve
miles
from
the
posting
station
a
fine
property
of
two
hundred
souls
or
as
he
expressed
it
since
he
had
arranged
the
division
of
his
land
with
the
peasants
and
started
a
farm of
nearly
five
thousand
acres
his
father
a
general
in
the
army
who
served
in

a
coarse
half educated
but
not
ill natured
man
a
typical
russian
had
been
in
harness
all
his
life
first
in
command
of
a
brigade
and
then
of
a
division
and
lived
constantly
in
the
provinces
where
by
virtue
of
his
rank
he
played
a
fairly
important
part
nikolai
petrovitch
was
born
in
the
south
of
russia
like
his
elder
brother
pavel
of
whom
more
hereafter
he
was
educated
at
home
till
he
was
fourteen
surrounded
by
cheap
tutors
free and
easy
but
toadying
adjutants
and
all
the
usual
regimental
and
staff
set
his
mother
one
of
the
kolyazin
family
as
a
girl
called
agathe
but
as
a
general s
wife
agathokleya
kuzminishna
kirsanov
was
one
of
those
military
ladies
who
take
their
full
share
of
the
duties
and
dignities
of
office
she
wore
gorgeous
caps
and
rustling
silk
dresses
in
church
she
was
the
first
to
advance
to
the
cross
she
talked
a
great
deal
in
a
loud
voice
let
her
children
kiss
her
hand
in
the
morning
and
gave
them
her
blessing
at
night in
fact
she
got
everything
out
of
life
she
could
nikolai
petrovitch
as
a
general s
son though
so
far
from
being
distinguished
by
courage
that
he
even
deserved
to
be
called
a
funk was
intended
like
his
brother
pavel
to
enter
the
army
but
he
broke
his
leg
on
the
very
day
when
the
news
of
his
commission
came
and
after
being
two
months
in
bed
retained
a
slight
limp
to
the
end
of
his
days
his
father
gave
him
up
as
a
bad
job
and
let
him
go
into
the
civil
service
he
took
him
to
petersburg
directly
he
was
eighteen
and
placed
him
in
the
university
his
brother
happened
about
the
same
time
to
be
made
an
officer
in
the
guards
the
young
men
started
living
together
in
one
set
of
rooms
under
the
remote
supervision
of
a
cousin
on
their
mother s
side
ilya
kolyazin
an
official
of
high
rank
their
father
returned
to
his
division
and
his
wife
and
only
rarely
sent
his
sons
large
sheets
of
grey
paper
scrawled
over
in
a
bold
clerkly
hand
at
the
bottom
of
these
sheets
stood
in
letters
enclosed
carefully
in
scroll work
the
words
piotr
kirsanov
general major
in

nikolai
petrovitch
left
the
university
a
graduate
and
in
the
same
year
general
kirsanov
was
put
on
to
the
retired
list
after
an
unsuccessful
review
and
came
to
petersburg
with
his
wife
to
live
he
was
about
to
take
a
house
in
the
tavrichesky
gardens
and
had
joined
the
english
club
but
he
died
suddenly
of
an
apoplectic
fit
agathokleya
kuzminishna
soon
followed
him
she
could
not
accustom
herself
to
a
dull
life
in
the
capital
she
was
consumed
by
the
ennui
of
existence
away
from
the
regiment
meanwhile
nikolai
petrovitch
had
already
in
his
parents
lifetime
and
to
their
no
slight
chagrin
had
time
to
fall
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
his
landlord
a
petty
official
prepolovensky
she
was
a
pretty
and
as
it
is
called
advanced
girl
she
used
to
read
the
serious
articles
in
the
science
column
of
the
journals
he
married
her
directly
the
term
of
mourning
was
over
and
leaving
the
civil
service
in
which
his
father
had
by
favour
procured
him
a
post
was
perfectly
blissful
with
his
masha
first
in
a
country
villa
near
the
lyesny
institute
afterwards
in
town
in
a
pretty
little
flat
with
a
clean
staircase
and
a
draughty
drawing room
and
then
in
the
country
where
he
settled
finally
and
where
in
a
short
time
a
son
arkady
was
born
to
him
the
young
couple
lived
very
happily
and
peacefully
they
were
scarcely
ever
apart
they
read
together
sang
and
played
duets
together
on
the
piano
she
tended
her
flowers
and
looked
after
the
poultry yard
he
sometimes
went
hunting
and
busied
himself
with
the
estate
while
arkady
grew
and
grew
in
the
same
happy
and
peaceful
way
ten
years
passed
like
a
dream
in

kirsanov s
wife
died
he
almost
succumbed
to
this
blow
in
a
few
weeks
his
hair
was
grey
he
was
getting
ready
to
go
abroad
if
possible
to
distract
his
mind

but
then
came
the
year

he
returned
unwillingly
to
the
country
and
after
a
rather
prolonged
period
of
inactivity
began
to
take
an
interest
in
improvements
in
the
management
of
his
land
in

he
brought
his
son
to
the
university
he
spent
three
winters
with
him
in
petersburg
hardly
going
out
anywhere
and
trying
to
make
acquaintance
with
arkady s
young
companions
the
last
winter
he
had
not
been
able
to
go
and
here
we
have
him
in
the
may
of

already
quite
grey
stoutish
and
rather
bent
waiting
for
his
son
who
had
just
taken
his
degree
as
once
he
had
taken
it
himself
the
servant
from
a
feeling
of
propriety
and
perhaps
too
not
anxious
to
remain
under
the
master s
eye
had
gone
to
the
gate
and
was
smoking
a
pipe
nikolai
petrovitch
bent
his
head
and
began
staring
at
the
crumbling
steps
a
big
mottled
fowl
walked
sedately
towards
him
treading
firmly
with
its
great
yellow
legs
a
muddy
cat
gave
him
an
unfriendly
look
twisting
herself
coyly
round
the
railing
the
sun
was
scorching
from
the
half dark
passage
of
the
posting
station
came
an
odour
of
hot
rye bread
nikolai
petrovitch
fell
to
dreaming
my
son

a
graduate

arkasha

were
the
ideas
that
continually
came
round
again
and
again
in
his
head
he
tried
to
think
of
something
else
and
again
the
same
thoughts
returned
he
remembered
his
dead
wife
she
did
not
live
to
see
it
he
murmured
sadly
a
plump
dark blue
pigeon
flew
into
the
road
and
hurriedly
went
to
drink
in
a
puddle
near
the
well
nikolai
petrovitch
began
looking
at
it
but
his
ear
had
already
caught
the
sound
of
approaching
wheels
it
sounds
as
if
they re
coming
sir
announced
the
servant
popping
in
from
the
gateway
nikolai
petrovitch
jumped
up
and
bent
his
eyes
on
the
road
a
carriage
appeared
with
three
posting horses
harnessed
abreast
in
the
carriage
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
blue
band
of
a
student s
cap
the
familiar
outline
of
a
dear
face
arkasha
arkasha
cried
kirsanov
and
he
ran
waving
his
hands
a
few
instants
later
his
lips
were
pressed
to
the
beardless
dusty
sunburnt cheek
of
the
youthful
graduate
chapter
ii
let
me
shake
myself
first
daddy
said
arkady
in
a
voice
tired
from
travelling
but
boyish
and
clear
as
a
bell
as
he
gaily
responded
to
his
father s
caresses
i
am
covering
you
with
dust
never
mind
never
mind
repeated
nikolai
petrovitch
smiling
tenderly
and
twice
he
struck
the
collar
of
his
son s
cloak
and
his
own
greatcoat
with
his
hand
let
me
have
a
look
at
you
let
me
have
a
look
at
you
he
added
moving
back
from
him
but
immediately
he
went
with
hurried
steps
towards
the
yard
of
the
station
calling
this
way
this
way
and
horses
at
once
nikolai
petrovitch
seemed
far
more
excited
than
his
son
he
seemed
a
little
confused
a
little
timid
arkady
stopped
him
daddy
he
said
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
great
friend
bazarov
about
whom
i
have
so
often
written
to
you
he
has
been
so
good
as
to
promise
to
stay
with
us
nikolai
petrovitch
went
back
quickly
and
going
up
to
a
tall
man
in
a
long
loose
rough
coat
with
tassels
who
had
only
just
got
out
of
the
carriage
he
warmly
pressed
the
ungloved
red
hand
which
the
latter
did
not
at
once
hold
out
to
him
i
am
heartily
glad
he
began
and
very
grateful
for
your
kind
intention
of
visiting
us
let
me
know
your
name
and
your
father s
yevgeny
vassilyev
answered
bazarov
in
a
lazy
but
manly
voice
and
turning
back
the
collar
of
his
rough
coat
he
showed
nikolai
petrovitch
his
whole
face
it
was
long
and
lean
with
a
broad
forehead
a
nose
flat
at
the
base
and
sharper
at
the
end
large
greenish
eyes
and
drooping
whiskers
of
a
sandy
colour
it
was
lighted
up
by
a
tranquil
smile
and
showed
self confidence
and
intelligence
i
hope
dear
yevgeny
vassilyitch
you
won t
be
dull
with
us
continued
nikolai
petrovitch
bazarov s
thin
lips
moved
just
perceptibly
though
he
made
no
reply
but
merely
took
off
his
cap
his
long
thick
hair
did
not
hide
the
prominent
bumps
on
his
head
then
arkady
nikolai
petrovitch
began
again
turning
to
his
son
shall
the
horses
be
put
to
at
once
or
would
you
like
to
rest
we
will
rest
at
home
daddy
tell
them
to
harness
the
horses
at
once
at
once
his
father
assented
hey
piotr
do
you
hear
get
things
ready
my
good
boy
look
sharp
piotr
who
as
a
modernised
servant
had
not
kissed
the
young
master s
hand
but
only
bowed
to
him
from
a
distance
again
vanished
through
the
gateway
i
came
here
with
the
carriage
but
there
are
three
horses
for
your
coach
too
said
nikolai
petrovitch
fussily
while
arkady
drank
some
water
from
an
iron
dipper
brought
him
by
the
woman
in
charge
of
the
station
and
bazarov
began
smoking
a
pipe
and
went
up
to
the
driver
who
was
taking
out
the
horses
there
are
only
two
seats
in
the
carriage
and
i
don t
know
how
your
friend

he
will
go
in
the
coach
interposed
arkady
in
an
undertone
you
must
not
stand
on
ceremony
with
him
please
he s
a
splendid
fellow
so
simple you
will
see
nikolai
petrovitch s
coachman
brought
the
horses
round
come

up

beard
said
bazarov
addressing
the
driver
do
you
hear
mityuha
put
in
another
driver
standing
by
with
his
hands
thrust
behind
him
into
the
opening
of
his
sheepskin
coat
what
the
gentleman
called
you
it s
a
bushy
beard
you
are
too
mityuha
only
gave
a
jog
to
his
hat
and
pulled
the
reins
off
the
heated
shaft
horse
look
sharp

sharp
lads

a
hand
cried
nikolai
petrovitch
there ll
be
something
to
drink
our
health
with
in
a
few
minutes
the
horses
were
harnessed
the
father
and
son
were
installed
in
the
carriage
piotr
climbed
up
on
to
the
box
bazarov
jumped
into
the
coach
and
nestled
his
head
down
into
the
leather
cushion
and
both
the
vehicles
rolled
away
chapter
iii
so
here
you
are
a
graduate
at
last
and
come
home
again
said
nikolai
petrovitch
touching
arkady
now
on
the
shoulder
now
on
the
knee
at
last
and
how
is
uncle
quite
well
asked
arkady
who
in
spite
of
the
genuine
almost
childish
delight
filling
his
heart
wanted
as
soon
as
possible
to
turn
the
conversation
from
the
emotional
into
a
commonplace
channel
quite
well
he
was
thinking
of
coming
with
me
to
meet
you
but
for
some
reason
or
other
he
gave
up
the
idea
and
how
long
have
you
been
waiting
for
me
inquired
arkady
oh
about
five
hours
dear
old
dad
arkady
turned
round
quickly
to
his
father
and
gave
him
a
sounding
kiss
on
the
cheek
nikolai
petrovitch
gave
vent
to
a
low
chuckle
i
have
got
such
a
capital
horse
for
you
he
began
you
will
see
and
your
room
has
been
fresh
papered
and
is
there
a
room
for
bazarov
we
will
find
one
for
him
too
please
dad
make
much
of
him
i
can t
tell
you
how
i
prize
his
friendship
have
you
made
friends
with
him
lately
yes
quite
lately
ah
that s
how
it
is
i
did
not
see
him
last
winter
what
does
he
study
his
chief
subject
is
natural
science
but
he
knows
everything
next
year
he
wants
to
take
his
doctor s
degree
ah
he s
in
the
medical
faculty
observed
nikolai
petrovitch
and
he
was
silent
for
a
little
piotr
he
went
on
stretching
out
his
hand
aren t
those
our
peasants
driving
along
piotr
looked
where
his
master
was
pointing
some
carts
harnessed
with
unbridled
horses
were
moving
rapidly
along
a
narrow
by road
in
each
cart
there
were
one
or
two
peasants
in
sheepskin
coats
unbuttoned
yes
sir
replied
piotr
where
are
they
going to
the
town
to
the
town
i
suppose
to
the
gin shop
he
added
contemptuously
turning
slightly
towards
the
coachman
as
though
he
would
appeal
to
him
but
the
latter
did
not
stir
a
muscle
he
was
a
man
of
the
old
stamp
and
did
not
share
the
modern
views
of
the
younger
generation
i
have
had
a
lot
of
bother
with
the
peasants
this
year
pursued
nikolai
petrovitch
turning
to
his
son
they
won t
pay
their
rent
what
is
one
to
do
but
do
you
like
your
hired
labourers
yes
said
nikolai
petrovitch
between
his
teeth
they re
being
set
against
me
that s
the
mischief
and
they
don t
do
their
best
they
spoil
the
tools
but
they
have
tilled
the
land
pretty
fairly
when
things
have
settled
down
a
bit
it
will
be
all
right
do
you
take
an
interest
in
farming
now
you ve
no
shade
that s
a
pity
remarked
arkady
without
answering
the
last
question
i
have
had
a
great
awning
put
up
on
the
north
side
over
the
balcony
observed
nikolai
petrovitch
now
we
can
have
dinner
even
in
the
open
air
it ll
be
rather
too
like
a
summer
villa
still
that s
all
nonsense
what
air
though
here
how
delicious
it
smells
really
i
fancy
there s
nowhere
such
fragrance
in
the
world
as
in
the
meadows
here
and
the
sky
too
arkady
suddenly
stopped
short
cast
a
stealthy
look
behind
him
and
said
no
more
of
course
observed
nikolai
petrovitch
you
were
born
here
and
so
everything
is
bound
to
strike
you
in
a
special
come
dad
that
makes
no
difference
where
a
man
is
born
still
no
it
makes
absolutely
no
difference
nikolai
petrovitch
gave
a
sidelong
glance
at
his
son
and
the
carriage
went
on
a
half a mile
further
before
the
conversation
was
renewed
between
them
i
don t
recollect
whether
i
wrote
to
you
began
nikolai
petrovitch
your
old
nurse
yegorovna
is
dead
really
poor
thing
is
prokofitch
still
living
yes
and
not
a
bit
changed
as
grumbling
as
ever
in
fact
you
won t
find
many
changes
at
maryino
have
you
still
the
same
bailiff
well
to
be
sure
there
is
a
change
there
i
decided
not
to
keep
about
me
any
freed
serfs
who
have
been
house
servants
or
at
least
not
to
intrust
them
with
duties
of
any
responsibility
arkady
glanced
towards
piotr
il
est
libre
en
effet
observed
nikolai
petrovitch
in
an
undertone
but
you
see
he s
only
a
valet
now
i
have
a
bailiff
a
townsman
he
seems
a
practical
fellow
i
pay
him
two
hundred
and
fifty
roubles
a
year
but
added
nikolai
petrovitch
rubbing
his
forehead
and
eyebrows
with
his
hand
which
was
always
an
indication
with
him
of
inward
embarrassment
i
told
you
just
now
that
you
would
not
find
changes
at
maryino
that s
not
quite
correct
i
think
it
my
duty
to
prepare
you
though
he
hesitated
for
an
instant
and
then
went
on
in
french
a
severe
moralist
would
regard
my
openness
as
improper
but
in
the
first
place
it
can t
be
concealed
and
secondly
you
are
aware
i
have
always
had
peculiar
ideas
as
regards
the
relation
of
father
and
son
though
of
course
you
would
be
right
in
blaming
me
at
my
age
in
short

that

that
girl
about
whom
you
have
probably
heard
already

fenitchka
asked
arkady
easily
nikolai
petrovitch
blushed
don t
mention
her
name
aloud
please
well

she
is
living
with
me
now
i
have
installed
her
in
the
house

there
were
two
little
rooms
there
but
that
can
all
be
changed
goodness
daddy
what
for
your
friend
is
going
to
stay
with
us

it
would
be
awkward

please
don t
be
uneasy
on
bazarov s
account
he s
above
all
that
well
but
you
too
added
nikolai
petrovitch
the
little
lodge
is
so
horrid
that s
the
worst
of
it
goodness
dad
interposed
arkady
it s
as
if
you
were
apologising
i
wonder
you re
not
ashamed
of
course
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
answered
nikolai
petrovitch
flushing
more
and
more
nonsense
dad
nonsense
please
don t
arkady
smiled
affectionately
what
a
thing
to
apologise
for
he
thought
to
himself
and
his
heart
was
filled
with
a
feeling
of
condescending
tenderness
for
his
kind
soft hearted
father
mixed
with
a
sense
of
secret
superiority
please
stop
he
repeated
once
more
instinctively
revelling
in
a
consciousness
of
his
own
advanced
and
emancipated
condition
nikolai
petrovitch
glanced
at
him
from
under
the
fingers
of
the
hand
with
which
he
was
still
rubbing
his
forehead
and
there
was
a
pang
in
his
heart
but
at
once
he
blamed
himself
for
it
here
are
our
meadows
at
last
he
said
after
a
long
silence
and
that
in
front
is
our
forest
isn t
it
asked
arkady
yes
only
i
have
sold
the
timber
this
year
they
will
cut
it
down
why
did
you
sell
it
the
money
was
needed
besides
that
land
is
to
go
to
the
peasants
who
don t
pay
you
their
rent
that s
their
affair
besides
they
will
pay
it
some
day
i
am
sorry
about
the
forest
observed
arkady
and
he
began
to
look
about
him
the
country
through
which
they
were
driving
could
not
be
called
picturesque
fields
upon
fields
stretched
all
along
to
the
very
horizon
now
sloping
gently
upwards
then
dropping
down
again
in
some
places
woods
were
to
be
seen
and
winding
ravines
planted
with
low
scanty
bushes
recalling
vividly
the
representation
of
them
on
the
old fashioned
maps
of
the
times
of
catherine
they
came
upon
little
streams
too
with
hollow
banks
and
tiny
lakes
with
narrow
dykes
and
little
villages
with
low
hovels
under
dark
and
often
tumble
down
roofs
and
slanting
barns
with
walls
woven
of
brushwood
and
gaping
doorways
beside
neglected
threshing floors
and
churches
some
brick built
with
stucco
peeling
off
in
patches
others
wooden
with
crosses
fallen
askew
and
overgrown
grave yards
slowly
arkady s
heart
sunk
to
complete
the
picture
the
peasants
they
met
were
all
in
tatters
and
on
the
sorriest
little
nags
the
willows
with
their
trunks
stripped
of
bark
and
broken
branches
stood
like
ragged
beggars
along
the
roadside
cows
lean
and
shaggy
and
looking
pinched
up
by
hunger
were
greedily
tearing
at
the
grass
along
the
ditches
they
looked
as
though
they
had
just
been
snatched
out
of
the
murderous
clutches
of
some
threatening
monster
and
the
piteous
state
of
the
weak
starved
beasts
in
the
midst
of
the
lovely
spring
day
called
up
like
a
white
phantom
the
endless
comfortless
winter
with
its
storms
and
frosts
and
snows
no
thought
arkady
this
is
not
a
rich
country
it
does
not
impress
one
by
plenty
or
industry
it
can t
it
can t
go
on
like
this
reforms
are
absolutely
necessary

but
how
is
one
to
carry
them
out
how
is
one
to
begin
such
were
arkady s
reflections

but
even
as
he
reflected
the
spring
regained
its
sway
all
around
was
golden
green
all trees
bushes
grass shone
and
stirred
gently
in
wide
waves
under
the
soft
breath
of
the
warm
wind
from
all
sides
flooded
the
endless
trilling
music
of
the
larks
the
peewits
were
calling
as
they
hovered
over
the
low lying
meadows
or
noiselessly
ran
over
the
tussocks
of
grass
the
rooks
strutted
among
the
half grown
short
spring corn
standing
out
black
against
its
tender
green
they
disappeared
in
the
already
whitening
rye
only
from
time
to
time
their
heads
peeped
out
amid
its
grey
waves
arkady
gazed
and
gazed
and
his
reflections
grew
slowly
fainter
and
passed
away
he
flung
off
his
cloak
and
turned
to
his
father
with
a
face
so
bright
and
boyish
that
the
latter
gave
him
another
hug
we re
not
far
off
now
remarked
nikolai
petrovitch
we
have
only
to
get
up
this
hill
and
the
house
will
be
in
sight
we
shall
get
on
together
splendidly
arkasha
you
shall
help
me
in
farming
the
estate
if
only
it
isn t
a
bore
to
you
we
must
draw
close
to
one
another
now
and
learn
to
know
each
other
thoroughly
mustn t
we
of
course
said
arkady
but
what
an
exquisite
day
it
is
to day
to
welcome
you
my
dear
boy
yes
it s
spring
in
its
full
loveliness
though
i
agree
with
pushkin do
you
remember
in
yevgeny
onyegin
to
me
how
sad
thy
coming
is
spring
spring
sweet
time
of
love
what

arkady
called
bazarov s
voice
from
the
coach
send
me
a
match
i ve
nothing
to
light
my
pipe
with
nikolai
petrovitch
stopped
while
arkady
who
had
begun
listening
to
him
with
some
surprise
though
with
sympathy
too
made
haste
to
pull
a
silver
matchbox
out
of
his
pocket
and
sent
it
to
bazarov
by
piotr
will
you
have
a
cigar
shouted
bazarov
again
thanks
answered
arkady
piotr
returned
to
the
carriage
and
handed
him
with
the
match box
a
thick
black
cigar
which
arkady
began
to
smoke
promptly
diffusing
about
him
such
a
strong
and
pungent
odour
of
cheap
tobacco
that
nikolai
petrovitch
who
had
never
been
a
smoker
from
his
youth
up
was
forced
to
turn
away
his
head
as
imperceptibly
as
he
could
for
fear
of
wounding
his
son
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
two
carriages
drew
up
before
the
steps
of
a
new
wooden
house
painted
grey
with
a
red
iron
roof
this
was
maryino
also
known
as
new wick
or
as
the
peasants
had
nicknamed
it
poverty
farm
chapter
iv
no
crowd
of
house serfs
ran
out
on
to
the
steps
to
meet
the
gentlemen
a
little
girl
of
twelve
years
old
made
her
appearance
alone
after
her
there
came
out
of
the
house
a
young
lad
very
like
piotr
dressed
in
a
coat
of
grey
livery
with
white
armorial
buttons
the
servant
of
pavel
petrovitch
kirsanov
without
speaking
he
opened
the
door
of
the
carriage
and
unbuttoned
the
apron
of
the
coach
nikolai
petrovitch
with
his
son
and
bazarov
walked
through
a
dark
and
almost
empty
hall
from
behind
the
door
of
which
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
young
woman s
face
into
a
drawing room
furnished
in
the
most
modern
style
here
we
are
at
home
said
nikolai
petrovitch
taking
off
his
cap
and
shaking
back
his
hair
that s
the
great
thing
now
we
must
have
supper
and
rest
a
meal
would
not
come
amiss
certainly
observed
bazarov
stretching
and
he
dropped
on
to
a
sofa
yes
yes
let
us
have
supper
supper
directly
nikolai
petrovitch
with
no
apparent
reason
stamped
his
foot
and
here
just
at
the
right
moment
comes
prokofitch
a
man
about
sixty
entered
white haired
thin
and
swarthy
in
a
cinnamon
coloured
dress coat
with
brass
buttons
and
a
pink
neckerchief
he
smirked
went
up
to
kiss
arkady s
hand
and
bowing
to
the
guest
retreated
to
the
door
and
put
his
hands
behind
him
here
he
is
prokofitch
began
nikolai
petrovitch
he s
come
back
to
us
at
last
well
how
do
you
think
him
looking
as
well
as
could
be
said
the
old
man
and
was
grinning
again
but
he
quickly
knitted
his
bushy
brows
you
wish
supper
to
be
served
he
said
impressively
yes
yes
please
but
won t
you
like
to
go
to
your
room
first
yevgeny
vassilyitch
no
thanks
i
don t
care
about
it
only
give
orders
for
my
little
box
to
be
taken
there
and
this
garment
too
he
added
taking
off
his
frieze
overcoat
certainly
prokofitch
take
the
gentleman s
coat
prokofitch
with
an
air
of
perplexity
picked
up
bazarov s
garment
in
both
hands
and
holding
it
high
above
his
head
retreated
on
tiptoe
and
you
arkady
are
you
going
to
your
room
for
a
minute
yes
i
must
wash
answered
arkady
and
was
just
moving
towards
the
door
but
at
that
instant
there
came
into
the
drawing room
a
man
of
medium
height
dressed
in
a
dark
english
suit
a
fashionable
low
cravat
and
kid
shoes
pavel
petrovitch
kirsanov
he
looked
about
forty five
his
close cropped
grey
hair
shone
with
a
dark
lustre
like
new
silver
his
face
yellow
but
free
from
wrinkles
was
exceptionally
regular
and
pure
in
line
as
though
carved
by
a
light
and
delicate
chisel
and
showed
traces
of
remarkable
beauty
specially
fine
were
his
clear
black
almond shaped
eyes
the
whole
person
of
arkady s
uncle
with
its
aristocratic
elegance
had
preserved
the
gracefulness
of
youth
and
that
air
of
striving
upwards
away
from
earth
which
for
the
most
part
is
lost
after
the
twenties
are
past
pavel
petrovitch
took
out
of
his
trouser
pocket
his
exquisite
hand
with
its
long
tapering
pink
nails
a
hand
which
seemed
still
more
exquisite
from
the
snowy
whiteness
of
the
cuff
buttoned
with
a
single
big
opal
and
gave
it
to
his
nephew
after
a
preliminary
handshake
in
the
european
style
he
kissed
him
thrice
after
the
russian
fashion
that
is
to
say
he
touched
his
cheek
three
times
with
his
perfumed
moustaches
and
said
welcome
nikolai
petrovitch
presented
him
to
bazarov
pavel
petrovitch
greeted
him
with
a
slight
inclination
of
his
supple
figure
and
a
slight
smile
but
he
did
not
give
him
his
hand
and
even
put
it
back
into
his
pocket
i
had
begun
to
think
you
were
not
coming
to day
he
began
in
a
musical
voice
with
a
genial
swing
and
shrug
of
the
shoulders
as
he
showed
his
splendid
white
teeth
did
anything
happen
on
the
road
nothing
happened
answered
arkady
we
were
rather
slow
but
we re
as
hungry
as
wolves
now
hurry
up
prokofitch
dad
and
i ll
be
back
directly
stay
i m
coming
with
you
cried
bazarov
pulling
himself
up
suddenly
from
the
sofa
both
the
young
men
went
out
who
is
he
asked
pavel
petrovitch
a
friend
of
arkasha s
according
to
him
a
very
clever
fellow
is
he
going
to
stay
with
us
yes
that
unkempt
creature
why
yes
pavel
petrovitch
drummed
with
his
finger
tips
on
the
table
i
fancy
arkady
s est
d gourdi
he
remarked
i m
glad
he
has
come
back
at
supper
there
was
little
conversation
bazarov
especially
said
nothing
but
he
ate
a
great
deal
nikolai
petrovitch
related
various
incidents
in
what
he
called
his
career
as
a
farmer
talked
about
the
impending
government
measures
about
committees
deputations
the
necessity
of
introducing
machinery
etc
pavel
petrovitch
paced
slowly
up
and
down
the
dining room
he
never
ate
supper
sometimes
sipping
at
a
wineglass
of
red
wine
and
less
often
uttering
some
remark
or
rather
exclamation
of
the
nature
of
ah
aha
hm
arkady
told
some
news
from
petersburg
but
he
was
conscious
of
a
little
awkwardness
that
awkwardness
which
usually
overtakes
a
youth
when
he
has
just
ceased
to
be
a
child
and
has
come
back
to
a
place
where
they
are
accustomed
to
regard
him
and
treat
him
as
a
child
he
made
his
sentences
quite
unnecessarily
long
avoided
the
word
daddy
and
even
sometimes
replaced
it
by
the
word
father
mumbled
it
is
true
between
his
teeth
with
an
exaggerated
carelessness
he
poured
into
his
glass
far
more
wine
than
he
really
wanted
and
drank
it
all
off
prokofitch
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
him
and
kept
chewing
his
lips
after
supper
they
all
separated
at
once
your
uncle s
a
queer
fish
bazarov
said
to
arkady
as
he
sat
in
his
dressing
gown
by
his
bedside
smoking
a
short
pipe
only
fancy
such
style
in
the
country
his
nails
his
nails you
ought
to
send
them
to
an
exhibition
why
of
course
you
don t
know
replied
arkady
he
was
a
great
swell
in
his
own
day
you
know
i
will
tell
you
his
story
one
day
he
was
very
handsome
you
know
used
to
turn
all
the
women s
heads
oh
that s
it
is
it
so
he
keeps
it
up
in
memory
of
the
past
it s
a
pity
there s
no
one
for
him
to
fascinate
here
though
i
kept
staring
at
his
exquisite
collars
they re
like
marble
and
his
chin s
shaved
simply
to
perfection
come
arkady
nikolaitch
isn t
that
ridiculous
perhaps
it
is
but
he s
a
splendid
man
really
an
antique
survival
but
your
father s
a
capital
fellow
he
wastes
his
time
reading
poetry
and
doesn t
know
much
about
farming
but
he s
a
good hearted
fellow
my
father s
a
man
in
a
thousand
did
you
notice
how
shy
and
nervous
he
is
arkady
shook
his
head
as
though
he
himself
were
not
shy
and
nervous
it s
something
astonishing
pursued
bazarov
these
old
idealists
they
develop
their
nervous
systems
till
they
break
down

so
balance
is
lost
but
good
night
in
my
room
there s
an
english
washstand
but
the
door
won t
fasten
anyway
that
ought
to
be
encouraged an
english
washstand
stands
for
progress
bazarov
went
away
and
a
sense
of
great
happiness
came
over
arkady
sweet
it
is
to
fall
asleep
in
one s
own
home
in
the
familiar
bed
under
the
quilt
worked
by
loving
hands
perhaps
a
dear
nurse s
hands
those
kind
tender
untiring
hands
arkady
remembered
yegorovna
and
sighed
and
wished
her
peace
in
heaven
for
himself
he
made
no
prayer
both
he
and
bazarov
were
soon
asleep
but
others
in
the
house
were
awake
long
after
his
son s
return
had
agitated
nikolai
petrovitch
he
lay
down
in
bed
but
did
not
put
out
the
candles
and
his
head
propped
on
his
hand
he
fell
into
long
reveries
his
brother
was
sitting
long
after
midnight
in
his
study
in
a
wide
armchair
before
the
fireplace
on
which
there
smouldered
some
faintly
glowing
embers
pavel
petrovitch
was
not
undressed
only
some
red
chinese
slippers
had
replaced
the
kid
shoes
on
his
feet
he
held
in
his
hand
the
last
number
of
galignani
but
he
was
not
reading
he
gazed
fixedly
into
the
grate
where
a
bluish
flame
flickered
dying
down
then
flaring
up
again
god
knows
where
his
thoughts
were
rambling
but
they
were
not
rambling
in
the
past
only
the
expression
of
his
face
was
concentrated
and
surly
which
is
not
the
way
when
a
man
is
absorbed
solely
in
recollections
in
a
small
back
room
there
sat
on
a
large
chest
a
young
woman
in
a
blue
dressing
jacket
with
a
white
kerchief
thrown
over
her
dark
hair
fenitchka
she
was
half
listening
half
dozing
and
often
looked
across
towards
the
open
door
through
which
a
child s
cradle
was
visible
and
the
regular
breathing
of
a
sleeping
baby
could
be
heard
chapter
v
the
next
morning
bazarov
woke
up
earlier
than
any
one
and
went
out
of
the
house
oh
my
he
thought
looking
about
him
the
little
place
isn t
much
to
boast
of
when
nikolai
petrovitch
had
divided
the
land
with
his
peasants
he
had
had
to
build
his
new
manor house
on
four
acres
of
perfectly
flat
and
barren
land
he
had
built
a
house
offices
and
farm
buildings
laid
out
a
garden
dug
a
pond
and
sunk
two
wells
but
the
young
trees
had
not
done
well
very
little
water
had
collected
in
the
pond
and
that
in
the
wells
tasted
brackish
only
one
arbour
of
lilac
and
acacia
had
grown
fairly
well
they
sometimes
had
tea
and
dinner
in
it
in
a
few
minutes
bazarov
had
traversed
all
the
little
paths
of
the
garden
he
went
into
the
cattle yard
and
the
stable
routed
out
two
farm boys
with
whom
he
made
friends
at
once
and
set
off
with
them
to
a
small
swamp
about
a
mile
from
the
house
to
look
for
frogs
what
do
you
want
frogs
for
sir
one
of
the
boys
asked
him
i ll
tell
you
what
for
answered
bazarov
who
possessed
the
special
faculty
of
inspiring
confidence
in
people
of
a
lower
class
though
he
never
tried
to
win
them
and
behaved
very
casually
with
them
i
shall
cut
the
frog
open
and
see
what s
going
on
in
his
inside
and
then
as
you
and
i
are
much
the
same
as
frogs
only
that
we
walk
on
legs
i
shall
know
what s
going
on
inside
us
too
and
what
do
you
want
to
know
that
for
so
as
not
to
make
a
mistake
if
you re
taken
ill
and
i
have
to
cure
you
are
you
a
doctor
then
yes
vaska
do
you
hear
the
gentleman
says
you
and
i
are
the
same
as
frogs
that s
funny
i m
afraid
of
frogs
observed
vaska
a
boy
of
seven
with
a
head
as
white
as
flax
and
bare
feet
dressed
in
a
grey
smock
with
a
stand up
collar
what
is
there
to
be
afraid
of
do
they
bite
there
paddle
into
the
water
philosophers
said
bazarov
meanwhile
nikolai
petrovitch
too
had
waked
up
and
gone
in
to
see
arkady
whom
he
found
dressed
the
father
and
son
went
out
on
to
the
terrace
under
the
shelter
of
the
awning
near
the
balustrade
on
the
table
among
great
bunches
of
lilacs
the
samovar
was
already
boiling
a
little
girl
came
up
the
same
who
had
been
the
first
to
meet
them
at
the
steps
on
their
arrival
the
evening
before
in
a
shrill
voice
she
said
fedosya
nikolaevna
is
not
quite
well
she
cannot
come
she
gave
orders
to
ask
you
will
you
please
to
pour
out
tea
yourself
or
should
she
send
dunyasha
i
will
pour
out
myself
myself
interposed
nikolai
petrovitch
hurriedly
arkady
how
do
you
take
your
tea
with
cream
or
with
lemon
with
cream
answered
arkady
and
after
a
brief
silence
he
uttered
interrogatively
daddy
nikolai
petrovitch
in
confusion
looked
at
his
son
well
he
said
arkady
dropped
his
eyes
forgive
me
dad
if
my
question
seems
unsuitable
to
you
he
began
but
you
yourself
by
your
openness
yesterday
encourage
me
to
be
open

you
will
not
be
angry

go
on
you
give
me
confidence
to
ask
you
isn t
the
reason
fen

isn t
the
reason
she
will
not
come
here
to
pour
out
tea
because
i m
here
nikolai
petrovitch
turned
slightly
away
perhaps
he
said
at
last
she
supposes

she
is
ashamed
arkady
turned
a
rapid
glance
on
his
father
she
has
no
need
to
be
ashamed
in
the
first
place
you
are
aware
of
my
views
it
was
very
sweet
to
arkady
to
utter
that
word
and
secondly
could
i
be
willing
to
hamper
your
life
your
habits
in
the
least
thing
besides
i
am
sure
you
could
not
make
a
bad
choice
if
you
have
allowed
her
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
you
she
must
be
worthy
of
it
in
any
case
a
son
cannot
judge
his
father least
of
all
i
and
least
of
all
such
a
father
who
like
you
has
never
hampered
my
liberty
in
anything
arkady s
voice
had
been
shaky
at
the
beginning
he
felt
himself
magnanimous
though
at
the
same
time
he
realised
he
was
delivering
something
of
the
nature
of
a
lecture
to
his
father
but
the
sound
of
one s
own
voice
has
a
powerful
effect
on
any
man
and
arkady
brought
out
his
last
words
resolutely
even
with
emphasis
thanks
arkasha
said
nikolai
petrovitch
thickly
and
his
fingers
again
strayed
over
his
eyebrows
and
forehead
your
suppositions
are
just
in
fact
of
course
if
this
girl
had
not
deserved
it
is
not
a
frivolous
caprice
it s
not
easy
for
me
to
talk
to
you
about
this
but
you
will
understand
that
it
is
difficult
for
her
to
come
here
in
your
presence
especially
the
first
day
of
your
return
in
that
case
i
will
go
to
her
cried
arkady
with
a
fresh
rush
of
magnanimous
feeling
and
he
jumped
up
from
his
seat
i
will
explain
to
her
that
she
has
no
need
to
be
ashamed
before
me
nikolai
petrovitch
too
got
up
arkady
he
began
be
so
good

how
can

there

i
have
not
told
you
yet

but
arkady
did
not
listen
to
him
and
ran
off
the
terrace
nikolai
petrovitch
looked
after
him
and
sank
into
his
chair
overcome
by
confusion
his
heart
began
to
throb
did
he
at
that
moment
realise
the
inevitable
strangeness
of
the
future
relations
between
him
and
his
son
was
he
conscious
that
arkady
would
perhaps
have
shown
him
more
respect
if
he
had
never
touched
on
this
subject
at
all
did
he
reproach
himself
for
weakness it
is
hard
to
say
all
these
feelings
were
within
him
but
in
the
state
of
sensations and
vague
sensations while
the
flush
did
not
leave
his
face
and
his
heart
throbbed
there
was
the
sound
of
hurrying
footsteps
and
arkady
came
on
to
the
terrace
we
have
made
friends
dad
he
cried
with
an
expression
of
a
kind
of
affectionate
and
good natured
triumph
on
his
face
fedosya
nikolaevna
is
not
quite
well
to day
really
and
she
will
come
a
little
later
but
why
didn t
you
tell
me
i
had
a
brother
i
should
have
kissed
him
last
night
as
i
have
kissed
him
just
now
nikolai
petrovitch
tried
to
articulate
something
tried
to
get
up
and
open
his
arms
arkady
flung
himself
on
his
neck
what s
this
embracing
again
sounded
the
voice
of
pavel
petrovitch
behind
them
father
and
son
were
equally
rejoiced
at
his
appearance
at
that
instant
there
are
positions
genuinely
affecting
from
which
one
longs
to
escape
as
soon
as
possible
why
should
you
be
surprised
at
that
said
nikolai
petrovitch
gaily
think
what
ages
i
have
been
waiting
for
arkasha
i ve
not
had
time
to
get
a
good
look
at
him
since
yesterday
i m
not
at
all
surprised
observed
pavel
petrovitch
i
feel
not
indisposed
to
be
embracing
him
myself
arkady
went
up
to
his
uncle
and
again
felt
his
cheeks
caressed
by
his
perfumed
moustache
pavel
petrovitch
sat
down
to
the
table
he
wore
an
elegant
morning
suit
in
the
english
style
and
a
gay
little
fez
on
his
head
this
fez
and
the
carelessly
tied
little
cravat
carried
a
suggestion
of
the
freedom
of
country
life
but
the
stiff
collars
of
his
shirt not
white
it
is
true
but
striped
as
is
correct
in
morning
dress stood
up
as
inexorably
as
ever
against
his
well
shaved
chin
where s
your
new
friend
he
asked
arkady
he s
not
in
the
house
he
usually
gets
up
early
and
goes
off
somewhere
the
great
thing
is
we
mustn t
pay
any
attention
to
him
he
doesn t
like
ceremony
yes
that s
obvious
pavel
petrovitch
began
deliberately
spreading
butter
on
his
bread
is
he
going
to
stay
long
with
us
perhaps
he
came
here
on
the
way
to
his
father s
and
where
does
his
father
live
in
our
province
sixty four
miles
from
here
he
has
a
small
property
there
he
was
formerly
an
army
doctor
tut
tut
tut
to
be
sure
i
kept
asking
myself
where
have
i
heard
that
name
bazarov
nikolai
do
you
remember
in
our
father s
division
there
was
a
surgeon
bazarov
i
believe
there
was
yes
yes
to
be
sure
so
that
surgeon
was
his
father
hm
pavel
petrovitch
pulled
his
moustaches
well
and
what
is
mr
bazarov
himself
he
asked
deliberately
what
is
bazarov
arkady
smiled
would
you
like
me
uncle
to
tell
you
what
he
really
is
if
you
will
be
so
good
nephew
he s
a
nihilist
eh
inquired
nikolai
petrovitch
while
pavel
petrovitch
lilted
a
knife
in
the
air
with
a
small
piece
of
butter
on
its
tip
and
remained
motionless
he s
a
nihilist
repeated
arkady
a
nihilist
said
nikolai
petrovitch
that s
from
the
latin
nihil
nothing
as
far
as
i
can
judge
the
word
must
mean
a
man
who

who
accepts
nothing
say
who
respects
nothing
put
in
pavel
petrovitch
and
he
set
to
work
on
the
butter
again
who
regards
everything
from
the
critical
point
of
view
observed
arkady
isn t
that
just
the
same
thing
inquired
pavel
petrovitch
no
it s
not
the
same
thing
a
nihilist
is
a
man
who
does
not
bow
down
before
any
authority
who
does
not
take
any
principle
on
faith
whatever
reverence
that
principle
may
be
enshrined
in
well
and
is
that
good
interrupted
pavel
petrovitch
that
depends
uncle
some
people
it
will
do
good
to
but
some
people
will
suffer
for
it
indeed
well
i
see
it s
not
in
our
line
we
are
old fashioned
people
we
imagine
that
without
principles
taken
as
you
say
on
faith
there s
no
taking
a
step
no
breathing
vous
avez
chang
tout
cela
god
give
you
good
health
and
the
rank
of
a
general
while
we
will
be
content
to
look
on
and
admire
worthy

what
was
it
nihilists
arkady
said
speaking
very
distinctly
yes
there
used
to
be
hegelists
and
now
there
are
nihilists
we
shall
see
how
you
will
exist
in
void
in
vacuum
and
now
ring
please
brother
nikolai
petrovitch
it s
time
i
had
my
cocoa
nikolai
petrovitch
rang
the
bell
and
called
dunyasha
but
instead
of
dunyasha
fenitchka
herself
came
on
to
the
terrace
she
was
a
young
woman
about
three and twenty
with
a
white
soft
skin
dark
hair
and
eyes
red
childishly pouting
lips
and
little
delicate
hands
she
wore
a
neat
print
dress
a
new
blue
kerchief
lay
lightly
on
her
plump
shoulders
she
carried
a
large
cup
of
cocoa
and
setting
it
down
before
pavel
petrovitch
she
was
overwhelmed
with
confusion
the
hot
blood
rushed
in
a
wave
of
crimson
over
the
delicate
skin
of
her
pretty
face
she
dropped
her
eyes
and
stood
at
the
table
leaning
a
little
on
the
very
tips
of
her
fingers
it
seemed
as
though
she
were
ashamed
of
having
come
in
and
at
the
same
time
felt
that
she
had
a
right
to
come
pavel
petrovitch
knitted
his
brows
severely
while
nikolai
petrovitch
looked
embarrassed
good
morning
fenitchka
he
muttered
through
his
teeth
good
morning
she
replied
in
a
voice
not
loud
but
resonant
and
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
arkady
who
gave
her
a
friendly
smile
she
went
gently
away
she
walked
with
a
slightly
rolling
gait
but
even
that
suited
her
for
some
minutes
silence
reigned
on
the
terrace
pavel
petrovitch
sipped
his
cocoa
suddenly
he
raised
his
head
here
is
sir
nihilist
coming
towards
us
he
said
in
an
undertone
bazarov
was
in
fact
approaching
through
the
garden
stepping
over
the
flower
beds
his
linen
coat
and
trousers
were
besmeared
with
mud
clinging
marsh
weed
was
twined
round
the
crown
of
his
old
round
hat
in
his
right
hand
he
held
a
small
bag
in
the
bag
something
alive
was
moving
he
quickly
drew
near
the
terrace
and
said
with
a
nod
good
morning
gentlemen
sorry
i
was
late
for
tea
i ll
be
back
directly
i
must
just
put
these
captives
away
what
have
you
there leeches
asked
pavel
petrovitch
no
frogs
do
you
eat
them or
keep
them
for
experiment
said
bazarov
indifferently
and
he
went
off
into
the
house
so
he s
going
to
cut
them
up
observed
pavel
petrovitch
he
has
no
faith
in
principles
but
he
has
faith
in
frogs
arkady
looked
compassionately
at
his
uncle
nikolai
petrovitch
shrugged
his
shoulders
stealthily
pavel
petrovitch
himself
felt
that
his
epigram
was
unsuccessful
and
began
to
talk
about
husbandry
and
the
new
bailiff
who
had
come
to
him
the
evening
before
to
complain
that
a
labourer
foma
was
deboshed
and
quite
unmanageable
he s
such
an
sop
he
said
among
other
things
in
all
places
he
has
protested
himself
a
worthless
fellow
he s
not
a
man
to
keep
his
place
he ll
walk
off
in
a
huff
like
a
fool
chapter
vi
bazarov
came
back
sat
down
to
the
table
and
began
hastily
drinking
tea
the
two
brothers
looked
at
him
in
silence
while
arkady
stealthily
watched
first
his
father
and
then
his
uncle
did
you
walk
far
from
here
nikolai
petrovitch
asked
at
last
where
you ve
a
little
swamp
near
the
aspen
wood
i
started
some
half dozen
snipe
you
might
slaughter
them
arkady
aren t
you
a
sportsman
then
no
is
your
special
study
physics
pavel
petrovitch
in
his
turn
inquired
physics
yes
and
natural
science
in
general
they
say
the
teutons
of
late
have
had
great
success
in
that
line
yes
the
germans
are
our
teachers
in
it
bazarov
answered
carelessly
the
word
teutons
instead
of
germans
pavel
petrovitch
had
used
with
ironical
intention
none
noticed
it
however
have
you
such
a
high
opinion
of
the
germans
said
pavel
petrovitch
with
exaggerated
courtesy
he
was
beginning
to
feel
a
secret
irritation
his
aristocratic
nature
was
revolted
by
bazarov s
absolute
nonchalance
this
surgeon s
son
was
not
only
not
overawed
he
even
gave
abrupt
and
indifferent
answers
and
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
there
was
something
churlish
almost
insolent
the
scientific
men
there
are
a
clever
lot
ah
ah
to
be
sure
of
russian
scientific
men
you
have
not
such
a
flattering
opinion
i
dare
say
that
is
very
likely
that s
very
praiseworthy
self abnegation
pavel
petrovitch
declared
drawing
himself
up
and
throwing
his
head
back
but
how
is
this
arkady
nikolaitch
was
telling
us
just
now
that
you
accept
no
authorities
don t
you
believe
in
them
and
how
am
i
accepting
them
and
what
am
i
to
believe
in
they
tell
me
the
truth
i
agree
that s
all
and
do
all
germans
tell
the
truth
said
pavel
petrovitch
and
his
face
assumed
an
expression
as
unsympathetic
as
remote
as
if
he
had
withdrawn
to
some
cloudy
height
not
all
replied
bazarov
with
a
short
yawn
he
obviously
did
not
care
to
continue
the
discussion
pavel
petrovitch
glanced
at
arkady
as
though
he
would
say
to
him
your
friend s
polite
i
must
say
for
my
own
part
he
began
again
not
without
some
effort
i
am
so
unregenerate
as
not
to
like
germans
russian
germans
i
am
not
speaking
of
now
we
all
know
what
sort
of
creatures
they
are
but
even
german
germans
are
not
to
my
liking
in
former
days
there
were
some
here
and
there
they
had well
schiller
to
be
sure
goethe

my
brother he
takes
a
particularly
favourable
view
of
them
but
now
they
have
all
turned
chemists
and
materialists

a
good
chemist
is
twenty
times
as
useful
as
any
poet
broke
in
bazarov
oh
indeed
commented
pavel
petrovitch
and
as
though
falling
asleep
he
faintly
raised
his
eyebrows
you
don t
acknowledge
art
then
i
suppose
the
art
of
making
money
or
of
advertising
pills
cried
bazarov
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
ah
ah
you
are
pleased
to
jest
i
see
you
reject
all
that
no
doubt
granted
then
you
believe
in
science
only
i
have
already
explained
to
you
that
i
don t
believe
in
anything
and
what
is
science science
in
the
abstract
there
are
sciences
as
there
are
trades
and
crafts
but
abstract
science
doesn t
exist
at
all
very
good
well
and
in
regard
to
the
other
traditions
accepted
in
human
conduct
do
you
maintain
the
same
negative
attitude
what s
this
an
examination
asked
bazarov
pavel
petrovitch
turned
slightly
pale
nikolai
petrovitch
thought
it
his
duty
to
interpose
in
the
conversation
we
will
converse
on
this
subject
with
you
more
in
detail
some
day
dear
yevgeny
vassilyitch
we
will
hear
your
views
and
express
our
own
for
my
part
i
am
heartily
glad
you
are
studying
the
natural
sciences
i
have
heard
that
liebig
has
made
some
wonderful
discoveries
in
the
amelioration
of
soils
you
can
be
of
assistance
to
me
in
my
agricultural
labours
you
can
give
me
some
useful
advice
i
am
at
your
service
nikolai
petrovitch
but
liebig s
miles
over
our
heads
one
has
first
to
learn
the
a
b
c
and
then
begin
to
read
and
we
haven t
set
eyes
on
the
alphabet
yet
you
are
certainly
a
nihilist
i
see
that
thought
nikolai
petrovitch
still
you
will
allow
me
to
apply
to
you
on
occasion
he
added
aloud
and
now
i
fancy
brother
it s
time
for
us
to
be
going
to
have
a
talk
with
the
bailiff
pavel
petrovitch
got
up
from
his
seat
yes
he
said
without
looking
at
any
one
it s
a
misfortune
to
live
five
years
in
the
country
like
this
far
from
mighty
intellects
you
turn
into
a
fool
directly
you
may
try
not
to
forget
what
you ve
been
taught
but in
a
snap they ll
prove
all
that s
rubbish
and
tell
you
that
sensible
men
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
such
foolishness
and
that
you
if
you
please
are
an
antiquated
old
fogey
what s
to
be
done
young
people
of
course
are
cleverer
than
we
are
pavel
petrovitch
turned
slowly
on
his
heels
and
slowly
walked
away
nikolai
petrovitch
went
after
him
is
he
always
like
that
bazarov
coolly
inquired
of
arkady
directly
the
door
had
closed
behind
the
two
brothers
i
must
say
yevgeny
you
weren t
nice
to
him
remarked
arkady
you
have
hurt
his
feelings
well
am
i
going
to
consider
them
these
provincial
aristocrats
why
it s
all
vanity
dandy
habits
fatuity
he
should
have
continued
his
career
in
petersburg
if
that s
his
bent
but
there
enough
of
him
i ve
found
a
rather
rare
species
of
a
water beetle
dytiscus
marginatus
do
you
know
it
i
will
show
you
i
promised
to
tell
you
his
story
began
arkady
the
story
of
the
beetle
come
don t
yevgeny
the
story
of
my
uncle
you
will
see
he s
not
the
sort
of
man
you
fancy
he
deserves
pity
rather
than
ridicule
i
don t
dispute
it
but
why
are
you
worrying
over
him
one
ought
to
be
just
yevgeny
how
does
that
follow
no
listen

and
arkady
told
him
his
uncle s
story
the
reader
will
find
it
in
the
following
chapter
chapter
vii
pavel
petrovitch
kirsanov
was
educated
first
at
home
like
his
younger
brother
and
afterwards
in
the
corps
of
pages
from
childhood
he
was
distinguished
by
remarkable
beauty
moreover
he
was
self confident
somewhat
ironical
and
had
a
rather
biting
humour
he
could
not
fail
to
please
he
began
to
be
seen
everywhere
directly
he
had
received
his
commission
as
an
officer
he
was
much
admired
in
society
and
he
indulged
every
whim
even
every
caprice
and
every
folly
and
gave
himself
airs
but
that
too
was
attractive
in
him
women
went
out
of
their
senses
over
him
men
called
him
a
coxcomb
and
were
secretly
jealous
of
him
he
lived
as
has
been
related
already
in
the
same
apartments
as
his
brother
whom
he
loved
sincerely
though
he
was
not
at
all
like
him
nikolai
petrovitch
was
a
little
lame
he
had
small
pleasing
features
of
a
rather
melancholy
cast
small
black
eyes
and
thin
soft
hair
he
liked
being
lazy
but
he
also
liked
reading
and
was
timid
in
society
pavel
petrovitch
did
not
spend
a
single
evening
at
home
prided
himself
on
his
ease
and
audacity
he
was
just
bringing
gymnastics
into
fashion
among
young
men
in
society
and
had
read
in
all
some
five
or
six
french
books
at
twenty
eight
he
was
already
a
captain
a
brilliant
career
awaited
him
suddenly
everything
was
changed
at
that
time
there
was
sometimes
seen
in
petersburg
society
a
woman
who
has
even
yet
not
been
forgotten
princess
r
she
had
a
well educated
well
bred
but
rather
stupid
husband
and
no
children
she
used
suddenly
to
go
abroad
and
suddenly
return
to
russia
and
led
an
eccentric
life
in
general
she
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
frivolous
coquette
abandoned
herself
eagerly
to
every
sort
of
pleasure
danced
to
exhaustion
laughed
and
jested
with
young
men
whom
she
received
in
the
dim
light
of
her
drawing room
before
dinner
while
at
night
she
wept
and
prayed
found
no
peace
in
anything
and
often
paced
her
room
till
morning
wringing
her
hands
in
anguish
or
sat
pale
and
chill
over
a
psalter
day
came
and
she
was
transformed
again
into
a
grand
lady
again
she
went
out
laughed
chattered
and
simply
flung
herself
headlong
into
anything
which
could
afford
her
the
slightest
distraction
she
was
marvellously
well proportioned
her
hair
coloured
like
gold
and
heavy
as
gold
hung
below
her
knees
but
no
one
would
have
called
her
a
beauty
in
her
whole
face
the
only
good
point
was
her
eyes
and
even
her
eyes
were
not
good they
were
grey
and
not
large but
their
glance
was
swift
and
deep
unconcerned
to
the
point
of
audacity
and
thoughtful
to
the
point
of
melancholy an
enigmatic
glance
there
was
a
light
of
something
extraordinary
in
them
even
while
her
tongue
was
lisping
the
emptiest
of
inanities
she
dressed
with
elaborate
care
pavel
petrovitch
met
her
at
a
ball
danced
a
mazurka
with
her
in
the
course
of
which
she
did
not
utter
a
single
rational
word
and
fell
passionately
in
love
with
her
being
accustomed
to
make
conquests
in
this
instance
too
he
soon
attained
his
object
but
his
easy
success
did
not
damp
his
ardour
on
the
contrary
he
was
in
still
more
torturing
still
closer
bondage
to
this
woman
in
whom
even
at
the
very
moment
when
she
surrendered
herself
utterly
there
seemed
always
something
still
mysterious
and
unattainable
to
which
none
could
penetrate
what
was
hidden
in
that
soul god
knows
it
seemed
as
though
she
were
in
the
power
of
mysterious
forces
incomprehensible
even
to
herself
they
seemed
to
play
on
her
at
will
her
intellect
was
not
powerful
enough
to
master
their
caprices
her
whole
behaviour
presented
a
series
of
inconsistencies
the
only
letters
which
could
have
awakened
her
husband s
just
suspicions
she
wrote
to
a
man
who
was
almost
a
stranger
to
her
whilst
her
love
had
always
an
element
of
melancholy
with
a
man
she
had
chosen
as
a
lover
she
ceased
to
laugh
and
to
jest
she
listened
to
him
and
gazed
at
him
with
a
look
of
bewilderment
sometimes
for
the
most
part
suddenly
this
bewilderment
passed
into
chill
horror
her
face
took
a
wild
death like
expression
she
locked
herself
up
in
her
bedroom
and
her
maid
putting
her
ear
to
the
keyhole
could
hear
her
smothered
sobs
more
than
once
as
he
went
home
after
a
tender
interview
kirsanov
felt
within
him
that
heartrending
bitter
vexation
which
follows
on
a
total
failure
what
more
do
i
want
he
asked
himself
while
his
heart
was
heavy
he
once
gave
her
a
ring
with
a
sphinx
engraved
on
the
stone
what s
that
she
asked
a
sphinx
yes
he
answered
and
that
sphinx
is
you
i
she
queried
and
slowly
raising
her
enigmatical
glance
upon
him
do
you
know
that s
awfully
flattering
she
added
with
a
meaningless
smile
while
her
eyes
still
kept
the
same
strange
look
pavel
petrovitch
suffered
even
while
princess
r
loved
him
but
when
she
grew
cold
to
him
and
that
happened
rather
quickly
he
almost
went
out
of
his
mind
he
was
on
the
rack
and
he
was
jealous
he
gave
her
no
peace
followed
her
about
everywhere
she
grew
sick
of
his
pursuit
of
her
and
she
went
abroad
he
resigned
his
commission
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
his
friends
and
the
exhortations
of
his
superiors
and
followed
the
princess
four
years
he
spent
in
foreign
countries
at
one
time
pursuing
her
at
another
time
intentionally
losing
sight
of
her
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
he
was
disgusted
with
his
own
lack
of
spirit

but
nothing
availed
her
image
that
incomprehensible
almost
meaningless
but
bewitching
image
was
deeply
rooted
in
his
heart
at
baden
he
once
more
regained
his
old
footing
with
her
it
seemed
as
though
she
had
never
loved
him
so
passionately

but
in
a
month
it
was
all
at
an
end
the
flame
flickered
up
for
the
last
time
and
went
out
for
ever
foreseeing
inevitable
separation
he
wanted
at
least
to
remain
her
friend
as
though
friendship
with
such
a
woman
was
possible
she
secretly
left
baden
and
from
that
time
steadily
avoided
kirsanov
he
returned
to
russia
and
tried
to
live
his
former
life
again
but
he
could
not
get
back
into
the
old
groove
he
wandered
from
place
to
place
like
a
man
possessed
he
still
went
into
society
he
still
retained
the
habits
of
a
man
of
the
world
he
could
boast
of
two
or
three
fresh
conquests
but
he
no
longer
expected
anything
much
of
himself
or
of
others
and
he
undertook
nothing
he
grew
old
and
grey
spending
all
his
evenings
at
the
club
jaundiced
and
bored
and
arguing
in
bachelor
society
became
a
necessity
for
him a
bad
sign
as
we
all
know
marriage
of
course
he
did
not
even
think
of
ten
years
passed
in
this
way
they
passed
by
colourless
and
fruitless and
quickly
fearfully
quickly
nowhere
does
time
fly
past
as
in
russia
in
prison
they
say
it
flies
even
faster
one
day
at
dinner
at
the
club
pavel
petrovitch
heard
of
the
death
of
the
princess
r
she
had
died
at
paris
in
a
state
bordering
on
insanity
he
got
up
from
the
table
and
a
long
time
he
paced
about
the
rooms
of
the
club
or
stood
stockstill
near
the
card players
but
he
did
not
go
home
earlier
than
usual
some
time
later
he
received
a
packet
addressed
to
him
in
it
was
the
ring
he
had
given
the
princess
she
had
drawn
lines
in
the
shape
of
a
cross
over
the
sphinx
and
sent
him
word
that
the
solution
of
the
enigma was
the
cross
this
happened
at
the
beginning
of
the
year

at
the
very
time
when
nikolai
petrovitch
came
to
petersburg
after
the
loss
of
his
wife
pavel
petrovitch
had
scarcely
seen
his
brother
since
the
latter
had
settled
in
the
country
the
marriage
of
nikolai
petrovitch
had
coincided
with
the
very
first
days
of
pavel
petrovitch s
acquaintance
with
the
princess
when
he
came
back
from
abroad
he
had
gone
to
him
with
the
intention
of
staying
a
couple
of
months
with
him
in
sympathetic
enjoyment
of
his
happiness
but
he
had
only
succeeded
in
standing
a
week
of
it
the
difference
in
the
positions
of
the
two
brothers
was
too
great
in

this
difference
had
grown
less
nikolai
petrovitch
had
lost
his
wife
pavel
petrovitch
had
lost
his
memories
after
the
death
of
the
princess
he
tried
not
to
think
of
her
but
to
nikolai
there
remained
the
sense
of
a
well
spent
life
his
son
was
growing
up
under
his
eyes
pavel
on
the
contrary
a
solitary
bachelor
was
entering
upon
that
indefinite
twilight
period
of
regrets
that
are
akin
to
hopes
and
hopes
that
are
akin
to
regrets
when
youth
is
over
while
old
age
has
not
yet
come
this
time
was
harder
for
pavel
petrovitch
than
for
another
man
in
losing
his
past
he
lost
everything
i
will
not
invite
you
to
maryino
now
nikolai
petrovitch
said
to
him
one
day
he
had
called
his
property
by
that
name
in
honour
of
his
wife
you
were
dull
there
in
my
dear
wife s
time
and
now
i
think
you
would
be
bored
to
death
i
was
stupid
and
fidgety
then
answered
pavel
petrovitch
since
then
i
have
grown
quieter
if
not
wiser
on
the
contrary
now
if
you
will
let
me
i
am
ready
to
settle
with
you
for
good
for
all
answer
nikolai
petrovitch
embraced
him
but
a
year
and
a
half
passed
after
this
conversation
before
pavel
petrovitch
made
up
his
mind
to
carry
out
his
intention
when
he
was
once
settled
